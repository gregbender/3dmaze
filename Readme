Legacy Project (2002) - This was my second attempt at openGL programming. It involves a 3D world that you can move around in using the arrow keys. Fog and Lights can be turned on and off. It features rudimentary collision detection, and an imported 3D Studio Max chair model.

Project 4

SOURCES: I generated the code for the chair using NuGraf's 3D
         modeling software.  (http://www.okino.com).  Also the
         function for reading in RAW texture files was found
         online at http://www.nullterminator.net/gltexture.html

NOTE:  This also seemed to take a very long time to compile, probably because
       the chair.c file is so big.
