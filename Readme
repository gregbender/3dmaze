Project 4

SOURCES: I generated the code for the chair using NuGraf's 3D
         modeling software.  (http://www.okino.com).  Also the
         function for reading in RAW texture files was found
         online at http://www.nullterminator.net/gltexture.html

NOTE:  This also seemed to take a very long time to compile, probably because
       the chair.c file is so big.
